		<p class="main">Douglas Engelbart was born in 1925. By the time he became
			a major developer of computer science in the 1960’s, computers
			were barely accessible to the public. They were used mainly for
			computing, processing, and storing information. He was the middle
			child in a family of three from Portland, Oregon. His father passed
			away when he was 9 years old, and halfway through his college 
			education in Corvallis, he was drafted into the Navy. During 
			this time, he read the article <cite>“As We May Think” </cite> by Vannevar 
			Bush. This article had a great impact on his life philosophy and 
			he went to on to be one of computer science’s greatest 
			contributors.</p>
			<p class="main">After the Navy he finished a bachelor’s degree in electrical
			engineering and then went on to get a PhD and M.S. the same field.
			Engelbart knew that information was already analyzed and stored
			by computers. He reasoned that the capacity for problem solving
			could be increased greatly by compiling existing knowledge;
			integrating information with technology to make it universal.
			In 1957 he went to work on his ideas at the Stanford Research 
			Institute for the next 20 years. During this time at SRI, he
			developed his <cite>“Program on Human Effectiveness”</cite> which says,
			<blockquote cite="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/extra4/sloan/mousesite/Archive/Post68/PrHumanEffectiveness.html">
			“Our aim is to bring significant improvement to the real-life
			problem-solving effectiveness of individuals.” </blockquote> This program 
			directly evolved concepts such as <cite>“augmenting human intellect,
			improvement infrastructure, co-evolution of artifacts with
			social-cultural language-practices, and bootstrapping.”</cite> His lab
			pioneered <cite>“an elaborate hypermedia-groupware system called <abbr>NLS</abbr>
			(for oN-Line System)”</cite> (douglasengelbart.org) Through this
			online system, integrated prototypes of renown technological
			firsts where operational. Breakthroughs such as: mouse,
			display editing, windows, cross-file editing, outline
			processing, hypermedia, and groupware.

			<p class="main">Perhaps his most famous accomplishment is coming up with
			the first concept of the computer mouse as an interactive tool
			for the computer. He received over 60 awards for his lifetime
			of work in Computer Science. Some of the more prestigious of
			these include the National Medal of Technology, 
			the Lemelson-MIT Prize, and ACM's 1997 A.M. Turing Award.</p>
			<p class="main">Douglas Engelbart was a hardworking dreamer. Some more
			interesting anecdotes found about him on his website are 
			below: “When Doug was growing up, he was poor and milked the 
			cow before he walked across several cow pastures to get to
			school in his dirty boots - you can imagine how he might 
			have been teased! And then, as an adult, his ideas were so
			different from the rest of his peers, he was told over and
			over that he was wrong, crazy, unacceptable, but he knew 
			inside that he was onto something important, so he thought
			of this quote ‘The rate at which a person can mature is directly
			proportional to the amount of embarrassment he can tolerate.’
			” Sounds like Engelbart knew all about hard work and overcoming
			adversity. The next quote really illustrates that he had an
			incredible imagination, with the brains to achieve his visions
			“ Since he had studied in college to be an engineer, and had
			been reading about the first computers, and had been
			trained on fancy new stuff called radar in World War II,
			he figured he could put that all together into a way that
			problem solvers could sit at "workingstations" and fly around
			their information space working on solutions together.”</p>
