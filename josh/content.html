  <p>10 + 10 = 100, the simplest of all mathematical calculations, presented in a way that a computer can understand. The Binary System of representing numbers is the basis for modern computing, allowing complicated numbers to be represented with simple electrical charges. Binary’s creator, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, was a man with a list of interests the length of a person"s arm. His interests lead to many advancements in numerous fields, from differential and integral calculus in mathematics to the hypothesis that the earth was once molten in geology, and of course, he developed binary <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">[1]</a>.</p>
  <p>Leibniz graduated with a masters in philosophy from Leipzig University and a doctorate in law from the University of Altdorf, both in Germany. It was during his time at university that he was exposed to many of the classic scientists and began incorporating their teachings into his personal philosophy, a major part of why he developed binary <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">[1]</a>. After graduation, he spent time practicing law under one of Germany’s leading statesmen before becoming a counselor for the Duke of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, the father of the man who would become King George I of England.</p>
  <p>In relation to his duties as counselor, Leibniz began examining the local mine, which eventually lead to his molten earth hypothesis. Additionally, during this time, he dabbled in engineering, such devices as hydraulic presses and clocks <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">[1]</a>.</p>
  <p>In addition to his accomplishments in geology, engineering, and history, this was also the period of Leibniz’s life during which he developed calculus and binary. Publishing “New Method for the Greatest and the Least” at the ripe old age of 39 and "Explanation of Binary Arithmetic, which uses only the characters 1 and 0..." at the age of 57.</p>
  <p>Nearing the end of his life, Leibniz"s original patron had died and been replaced by the man who would become King George I, who tasked Leibniz with creating a genealogy proving that his new patron was a descendant of a princely Italian family. He expanded this prerogative into a complete history of the entire earth <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">[1]</a>; a work he, unfortunately, never finished.</p>
  <p>Leibniz died in 1716, age 70, and it was a death swathed in controversy: Claims of plagiarising Newton"s works on calculus had strained relations between Leibniz and his patron, King George I. It is unknown exactly why King George I chose to side with Newton over Leibniz, however, it seems that the British Royal Society was biased against Leibniz, and the rest of England, including the king, followed suit. Unfortunately, Newton’s claim was later proven false after both men had died <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Totally not Wikipedia">[2]</a>.</p>
  <p>Leibniz was defined by his devout Lutheranism and belief in cosmopolitanism. He developed binary in an attempt to create a universal symbolic language meant both to solve philosophical problems mathematically and provide a universal language for scientific communication <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Da_oP3sJs1oC&pg=PA4153#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Leibniz, Mysticism and Religion">[3]</a>.<p>
  <p>Perhaps, he is a man history should not forget.</p>
